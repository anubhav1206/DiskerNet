   - You can download pre-built releases from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/crisdosyago/Diskernet/releases). Choose the appropriate version for your operating system and follow the installation instructions.

2. **Setup and Configuration**:
   - Once installed, DiskerNet doesn't require any additional browser plugins or extensions.
   - After installation, DiskerNet runs as a local server on your machine, acting as a bridge between your browser and the archived content.

3. **Real-time Archiving**:
   - DiskerNet works in the background while you browse the internet. It automatically captures and saves the content you encounter, allowing you to revisit it later.
   - When you come across something interesting, whether it's an article, image, or webpage, DiskerNet gives you the option to archive it.

4. **Bookmark-Worthy Content**:
   - DiskerNet provides the flexibility to choose what to archive. You can save everything you come across or only bookmark-worthy items, helping you maintain a focused and organized archive.

5. **Centralized Archive**:
   - All the archived content is stored locally on your machine, giving you complete control over your data.
   - The content is organized efficiently, making it easy for you to find saved items without wasting time.

6. **Search and Retrieval**:
   - DiskerNet acts as your personal search engine for your archived content.
   - It offers a full-text search feature, allowing you to quickly find specific items by searching for keywords or phrases.

7. **Security and Privacy**:
   - DiskerNet takes your privacy seriously. Since it operates locally on your machine, your data remains under your control.
   - The optional support for local SSL certificates ensures secure communication between the DiskerNet server and your browser.

8. **Sharing Options**:
   - While DiskerNet prioritizes individual control, it also offers sharing options. You can choose to share specific archived content with others if desired.
